OFF-ROAD TAX-FREE DIESEL
Dyed diesel is one of the best investments for companies dealing with vehicles frequently off-road. Its name comes from
the red dye that marks the fuel recommended for these vehicles. Companies use them for construction, off-road equipment,
agricultural vehicles, generators, and more. You’ll often find the dye residue in the fuel through black light.
As one of the largest suppliers of dyed fuel in Texas, Ricochet Fuel is your reliable option to get the off-road diesel
you need. We use only the best equipment to supply you with premium fuel that can help you run your business.
Ricochet Fuel can provide tax-free off-road diesel in all size quantities delivered directly to your site 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.

TEXAS DYED DIESEL REGULATIONS
For off-road use vehicles only, this diesel can be purchased tax-free since it is not intended for vehicles operated on
tax-funded roads. Due to its tax-free nature, states across the nation have extra requirements in order to purchase for
both buyers and sellers. Texas has a strict set of requirements for off-road diesel purchases companies must follow.
Do I need a Texas-dyed diesel statement to purchase dyed diesel? Yes, if you are storing dyed diesel in a tank. No, if
you are using dyed diesel in a generator or directly in equipment.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLEAR AND DYED DIESEL
Dyed diesel refers to off-road diesel sold in the United States. On the other hand, clear diesel is used by on-road
vehicles. The distinction is the color, as off-road diesel uses solvent red 26, regulated by the IRS for off-road use
only. On-road diesel has a green dye that makes them distinct.
Clear or on-road diesel has a bright appearance with a slightly greenish color. It will fade to a yellow or darker green
when dry. When it comes to using it, the most notable difference is that dyed diesel is for off-road vehicles and equipment.
You cannot use dyed diesel on the road as mandated. The reason for this strict mandate is because of fuel taxation.

TAX-FREE DIESEL
Dyed diesel is tax-free, meaning you can get it for much cheaper. The reason for it being so is that it is not paying
the road tax required for on-road diesel. Since this diesel isn’t for roads, you don’t have to pay the tax, and save
money while still getting the same quality.
Businesses can save much money by using dyed diesel for their off-road equipment. Are you keeping generators stored
for use during severe weather or power outages? Dyed diesel is the best option for you. Many industries can also rely on
dyed diesel and save money while increasing profitability.

HOW TO GET DYED DIESEL FROM US
Ricochet Fuel Distributors offers bulk fuel deliveries to businesses operating in and out of Texas. Our trucks will
deliver the fuel you ordered and handle all the logistics for you. On-site fuel delivery means you’ll get the supply
you need on time while saving money thanks to your order of dyed diesel. We deliver 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
There is a regulation from Texas that requires businesses to go through dyed diesel fuel applications before they can
buy. There is a strict mandate for those using dyed diesel inside fuel tanks for vehicles. However, you don’t need to
go through the application if you store the fuel directly in equipment like generators.

FUEL SUPPLY & TANK RENTALS
Ricochet Fuel can supply dyed diesel at an on-site tank, at the pump, or by fueling equipment overnight. Ricochet Fuel
can provide on-site tanks in various sizes for your job site, yard, and fleet fueling needs.

ON-ROAD DIESEL DELIVERED
On-road diesel is the essential fuel for many vehicles traversing highways and cities. Also known as clear diesel, it
is one of the most commonly used fuels by cars in the US. Ricochet Fuel is your trusted distributor when getting the
diesel supply you need for your business. We offer bulk fuel delivery and overnight fueling, as well as on-site services.
Ricochet Fuel can meet your on-road diesel needs from small volume purchases to entire truckloads. Bulk fuels can be
delivered to customers around the clock via bobtail, transport, or on-site refueling service.

WHAT IS ON-ROAD DIESEL?
On-road – also called “highway diesel” – is regular diesel any customer can purchase from a gas station. It is distinct
from off-road diesel or dyed diesel because the off-road variety is tax-exempt and designated for use in construction,
agriculture, and several other specific niches.
Whether you have your own on-site tank or need a tank loaned from us, Ricochet Fuel will deliver your diesel where you
need it and when you need it!


THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ON-ROAD AND OFF-ROAD DIESEL
The most notable difference between on-road and off-road diesel is its taxation. On-road diesel has higher prices because
they incur road taxes set by the government. Clear diesel has a green dye placed on it to help with categorization and
regulation. Anyone caught using dyed off-road diesel for road vehicles can incur fines and penalties from the government.
Off-road diesel also has a red color which can turn yellow or dark red when drying up. The IRS placed these regulations
which all businesses and individuals must follow in the country.

WHERE CAN I GET ON-ROAD DIESEL?
On-road diesel is available through Ricochet Fuel Distributors. You can visit us and refuel through pumps and fuel cards.
The alternative is to order from us, where we’ll provide bulk fuel delivery to your location. We can fill your on-site
tank, or you can loan one from us to be delivered with your fuel.
With consistent round-the-clock service, you can get the fuel you need with Ricochet.

DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID (DEF)
Ricochet Fuel can supply you with Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) in several forms so we can provide the right solution for your company.
What is diesel exhaust fluid? DEF is required for medium to heavy-duty vehicles and construction vehicles with diesel
engines produced after 2010. The vehicle is programmed to inject the DEF into the exhaust stream to meet emissions
requirements. If the vehicle is allowed to run out of DEF, the engine performance will be reduced, and lower speeds are imposed.
Available at the pump with your CFN card at our Euless location as well as other designated locations 24/7.

BULK DEF DELIVERY NEAR ME
DEF jugs for saleRicochet Fuel can supply bulk diesel exhaust fluid in a variety ways to meet your needs. We offer –
2.5 gallon jugs available for pickup or delivery

Loaned bulk tanks with electric dispensers (larger than 330 gallons)
Ricochet Fuel even has diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) available at the pump with your CFN card at our Euless
location as well as other designated locations 24/7.

FAQS – DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID
How Often Do You Have to Add Diesel Exhaust Fluid?
2.5 gallons of DEF will last approximately 800 miles on the road. That means, 1 gallon of DEF will last about 300 to 500
miles. You can figure, for every 50 gallons of diesel, you’ll need 1 gallon of DEF. One important note, make sure you
don’t allow your DEF to go completely dry.
What Happens When You Run Out of Diesel Exhaust Fluid?
All new vehicles are equipped with gauges and/or lights to alert you when DEF is low. If DEF is not replaced, an
emergency light will be triggered, and engine speed will be reduced to as little as five miles per hour.
To be prepared, it’s smart to carry a bottle in your truck, so you don’t get stuck driving slow on the shoulder of
the highway. It’s also good to know that diesel exhaust fluid is nontoxic. So for you, that means once you have some
on hand, you or your fleet’s drivers, can readily replace DEF, as needed.
Who can I contact for a reliable Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) supplier?

petroleum diesel, making it a “drop-in” fuel that can directly replace conventional diesel in engines without modification.

and infrastructure.

ONSITE FUELING
on-site refuelingWhat is onsite fueling and why should you use it? Also known as wet hosing or mobile fueling, on-site
refueling involves a fuel transport delivering fuel directly to equipment and vehicles at a job site, yard, or company location.
On-site refueling is best utilized as an alternative to fuel cards, when there is no space for on-site tanks, or when a
company is looking for the convenience of fueling at a number of locations at different times.

WHY ON-SITE REFUELING IS CONVENIENT
FuelingThere are countless variables every time your fleet makes a trip to fuel. From traffic to construction, drivers are rarely in control of the time it takes to get back and forth from the gas station and the worksite.

If your worksite is conveniently located near a fueling station is wet hosing less advantageous? Perhaps. However, consider that miles quickly add up. For some businesses, reducing mileage, as well as the general vehicle wear and tear that goes with, eventually outweighs any additional costs of wet hosing services.

For larger projects utilizing largescale machinery, a trip to fuel is not only inefficient, it is unsafe or impossible.

IS ON-SITE REFUELING RIGHT FOR MY FLEET?
There are three big questions to ask as you consider whether wet hosing is the best fit for your fleet:
Are there any better alternatives?
Is your worksite fixed and ready for an on-site fuel tank, or is there considerable paperwork to dig through before
a tank could be installed? Where is the nearest fueling station and is it readily accessible for your fleet? Eliminating
other fueling options will quickly determine if wet hosing is the most logical fit.
What is your project’s timeline?
Little time to spare? Wet hosing services, if booked through a reliable provider, can save you valuable time. At
Ricochet Fuel, diesel, gasoline, or oil is delivered in any quantity at any time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Emergency service is also available. If your timetable is tight, these services are essential to prevent delays.
How important is record-keeping?
If your business has ever struggled with fuel mismanagement, a fuel-distributor controlled service, such as wet hosing,
may be worth considering.

FUEL CARDS
One of the most powerful assets you can have for your fleet is fuel cards. The chief benefit of having one is fuel
savings. However, you can enjoy other advantages like more streamlined operations, prevention of fraudulent gas charges,
and even data that you can use for analytics. At Ricochet Fuel, we offer CFN FleetWide cards that allow your fleet to
take advantage of this fueling method. Contact us to get yours!
BENEFITS OF USING FUEL CARDS
Here are some of the perks of using fleet cards for your logistics or shipping operations:
CONVENIENT FOR DRIVERS
Fueling manually burdens drivers with responsibilities like collecting receipts and covering fuel before reimbursement.
This hassle shouldn’t be put on them as it also creates additional overhead. Thankfully, a fuel card can contain the
amount they need to pay for fuel and other expenses. With this limit, you can also be in control of how much drivers spend.
PREVENTS FRAUDULENT GAS CHARGES
There are cases when drivers use low fuel grades, skim the fuel for personal use, or buy non-fuel items using gas money.
With a fuel card, you have a preventative measure for these practices and be more aware of how your drivers are spending.
PROVIDES DATA FOR EXPENSE REPORTS
The breadth of data you get from these cards can be used in many ways. The information can help you track your expenses
on fuel, optimize routes for maximum savings, and understand the fueling habits of drivers for corrective action.
MORE SAVINGS FOR YOUR COMPANY
All the benefits above come together to help your company save on fuel expenses. Aside from that, some cards offer
reduced rates for even more savings. If you have the right card, you could see savings of up to $1,080 per truck every year!
ACCESS TO MORE SITES AND PRODUCTS
Certain cards like the CFN FleetWide card allows your fleet to refuel in all participating gas stations and truck stops.
In addition, you could access other petroleum products depending on your needs.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CFN FLEETWIDE FUELING PROGRAM
Ricochet Fuel is a proud member of the CFN FleetWide fueling program. So when you have our cards, your fleet can refuel
at more than 57,000 sites all over the world.

WHY FUEL CARDS?
Employees do not use the lowest fuel grade
Employees skim for personal use and bought non-fuel items
Employees waste time at the convenience store
Employees do not receive the posted “cash price”
Industry experts show the right fuel card will save $1,080 per truck – A YEAR!
If your business does not allow temporary tanks or bulk fuel delivery, then our fleet card options will
provide you a very secure option for fueling at our convenient sites.

WHAT IS DYED DIESEL?
Known as: Dyed Diesel, Tax-Free Diesel, Off-Road Diesel, Red Diesel
Dyed diesel is not taxed because it is not used in vehicles driven on public roads. This makes it cheaper than on-road
diesel. There is no difference in performance between the two types of diesel.
Dyed diesel can save your business up to 44 cents/gallon.
